# VAR-Rover
This repository is for a senior design project at Penn State Behrend. The goal of the project is to create rover for the Virtual/Augmented Realty Lab on campus.

The rover's tasks are to:
- Carry/transport the camera equipment, which consist of an Insta360 Pro2 camera and a FARO Focus Laser Scanner
- Automatically level the equipment as the rover is driving
- Be able to raise and lower the equipment to a desired height
- Be remote controlled
- Have a long battery life
- Be able to traverse rough terrain, such as the Wintergreen Gorge on campus.

The project was started in August 2021.
